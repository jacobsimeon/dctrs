They also work with emotionally healthy individuals adjusting to developmental issues, life crises, or disabilities. The PTR completes an advanced level of training and fieldwork, commensurate with the highest levels of clinical practice. The terms poetry therapy, applied poetry facilitation, journal therapy, bibliotherapy, biblio/poetry therapy, and poetry/journal therapy reflect the interactive use of literature and/or writing to promote personal growth and emotional healing. In addition to poetry, poetry therapy applies all forms or written and spoken language including story, myth, folk and fairy tale and other genres of poetic expression as well as journal, memoir, and narrative. The poetry therapy process integrates discussion of published literature and reflective or creative writing for expression and communication of thoughts and feelings to facilitate participants' emotional well-being.

Chiropractic radiologists recommend, supervise, and interpret radiologic studies as well as advanced imaging procedures. They advise referring physicians on the necessity and appropriateness of radiologic services and whether to select or to avoid certain diagnostic or clinical procedures. In some instances the radiologist may act as a private practitioner. They may conduct research and apply diagnostic radiologic procedures and may be called upon to act as expert witnesses in matters of litigation.    Chiropractic radiologists are also concerned with imaging technology including image production, demonstration of normal and abnormal anatomy, and the interaction of energy and matter. The advances in the technological facets of radiology are so rapid that only qualified radiologists can reasonably be expected to maintain the high level of proficiency required to supervise and interpret these procedures. The practice of radiology continuously involves the application of this technology to patient imaging and treatment.    It is now well recognized that chiropractic radiology includes, but is not limited to, plain film radiography, fluoroscopy, tomography, ultrasonography, radioisotope imaging, computed tomography, digital radiography, and magnetic resonance imaging.

The American Midwifery Certification Board, Inc. [AMCB, formerly the ACNM Certification Council, Inc. (ACC)] opened its national certification exam to non-nurse graduates of midwifery education programs and issued the first certified midwife (CM) credential in 1997. Certified midwives are educated to meet the same high standards that certified nurse-midwives must meet. These are the standards that every state in the U.S. has recognized as the legal basis for nurse-midwifery practice. All education programs for CMs, like CNMs, award a post-baccalaureate certificate or higher degree. CMs take the same AMCB certification exam as CNMs and study side by side with nurse-midwifery students in some education programs. As an organization, ACNM supports efforts to legally recognize CMs as qualified midwifery practitioners granted the same rights and responsibilities as CNMs."
